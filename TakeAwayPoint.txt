Installation 
npm i -g typescript
npm i -g ts-node //ts-node lets you run TypeScript code without needing to compile it to JavaScript first. 

console.log('Hello this is a test);
//Typescript is built on top of Javascript so whatever written in js could be included in ts

In Typescript : 
let age : number = 20  //Explaining a variable in typescript
age = 'a' // Throws not assignable to type 'number error'
console.log(age) // Error

In Javascript :
let age = 20;
age = 'Test'
console.log(age) // Test
